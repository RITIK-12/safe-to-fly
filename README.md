### Introduction
* Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) finds itâ€™s application in various fields such as forestry, aerial photography, agriculture, meteorological predictions, and nowadays even for express delivery.
* Fixed-wing UAVs (FW-UAVs) are the most extensive UAV types and are employed for challenging tasks that require more speed and endurance. 
* The UAV crash caused due to malfunctions will undoubtedly result in significant economic loss, have a negative impact on the military, and even cause political and social problems
* Hence, the real-time diagnosis of these complex systems is a vital to ensure their operability in critical missions.
